__Usage:__

Should be used after `deviceready` event has fired, and before any senstive data has been attempted to be transmitted.

The object returned from the `installIfNeededAsync()`'s promise is a JSON object that has a key of `providerInstalledUpdated` with `not_available`, `installed`, or `action_required`.

The app consuming this can warn the user after that additional actions need to be taken, if necessary.


ES6+/Ionic:
```
      declare var SecurityProvider;

...
      SecurityProvider.installIfNeededAsync().then(data => {
        console.log('Everything is good: ' + data);
      }).catch(error => {
        console.log("Something is wrong with this device's Google Play Services");
        console.log('What is the error?: ' + error);
      });

```
